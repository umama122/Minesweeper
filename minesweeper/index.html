        <h2>How to Play Minesweeper (Without Blowing Yourself Up)</h2> <ul> <li><b>It's a Minefield Out There:</b> The game board is a grid full of cells. Some cells have bombs that will blast you to smithereens! Other cells are safe and cozy.</li> <li><b>Choose Wisely Grasshopper:</b> Click a cell to reveal it. If you don't see an earth-shattering KABOOM, woohoo! The number tells you how many bombs are lurking nearby. Keep clicking safe cells to rack up points.</li> <li><b>Avoid the Hot Potatoes:</b> Clicking a bomb ends the game real quick. You'll get slapped with a "Game Over" screen as punishment. Rude!</li> <li><b>Mark Suspicious Cells:</b> Right-click a cell to place a flag if you think it's a bomb. This helps jog your memory on places to avoid. </li> <li><b>Mission: Don't Explode!</b> Reveal all the safe cells while steering clear of bombs to win. Party like it's 1999 when you are victorious!</li> </ul> <p>It takes some luck and logic, but you'll be a Minesweeper master in no time. Listen for sleigh bells ringing when you win, or prepare for the sad trombone if you detonate.</p> <p>May the minesweep odds be ever in your favor! Now go bomb some bomblets!</p> </div>
